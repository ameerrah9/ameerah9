# Hello üëãüèæ
My name is Ghameerah McCullers and I‚Äôm a creative software engineer and problem solver with experience in JavaScript, RESTful routing, managing related data, Content Management Systems, and single-page applications. With a background in sports and finance, I utilize data and cross-functional collaboration to build compelling product experiences and assist with implementing abstract ideas that make sense to people and organizations so that they can help people communicate and interact.

My background actually begins as a student-athlete. I attended Central State University, which happens to be one of the first Historical Black Colleges/Universities. I graduated in 2017 with cumme Laude honors and won a Women‚Äôs basketball championship. I then started my career as a cook and manager at Waffle House & after two years, I decided to transition into tech!

I'm a people person and would love to connect. Please shoot me a message if you'd like to network.
